									</header>
									<h4>Top 5 States by Mortality Rate</h4>
									<p>When looking at the states with the highest overall mortality rates by race and gender, 4 of the top 5 states are within the southern United States. 
										Mississippi has the highest mortality rate at 106 deaths by stroke per 100,000 of the population.</p>
									<div class="col-6"><span class="image"><img src="images/Stroke Top 5 Mortality.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									<p></p>
									<h4>Mortality Rates by Race/Ethnicity</h4>
									<p>Those who identified as Back were the racial/ethnic group with the highest overall mortality rate, followed by Native Hawaiians and Other Pacific Islanders, 
										and White individuals. Those belonging to the Hispanic, American Indian or Alaskan Native, and Asian racial groups demonstrated overall rates between 61.10 
										- 67.40. Individuals who identified as more than one race demonstrated the lowest overall stroke rate at 37.00.</p>
									<div class="col-6"><span class="image"><img src="images/Stroke Mortality by Race.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									<p></p>
									<h4>Mortality Rates by Race/Ethnicity and Gender</h4>
									<p>When looking at mortality rates by race and gender, it is apparent that Black men are by far the most at risk to die due to a stroke. In the majority of 
										racial/ethnic groups, demonstrate an equivalent or higher stroke mortality rate, with the exception of those identifying as more than one race. In this 
										category, women had a slightly higher recorded mortality rate. </p>

									<h2>Overview</h2>
									<p>In this project, I analyzed the <a href="https://data.cdc.gov/Heart-Disease-Stroke-Prevention/Stroke-Mortality-Data-Among-US-Adults-35-by-State-/vutr-sfkh/about_data">stroke mortality rates</a> 
										in U.S.adults ages 35 and over between 2019 and 2021. The mortality rates were presented as a 3-year average 
										of mortality rates recorded during that period of time. Mortality rates were provided at the national, state, 
										and county level and categorized by gender and race.</p>

										<h2>Data Cleaning and Exploration</h2>
									</header>
									<h4>Unique Values</h4>
									</header>
										<p>	When looking at unique values, it was shown that there are several categories that only contain one unique value. The unique value in "StratificationCategory1", for example, was "Gender", 
											which was meant to indicate what the category label for "Stratification1" was. These were considered not beneficial for analysis and later removed. For "Year" column, only listed 2020 
											for all rows. As stated previously, the mortality rates were presented as a 3-year average, so the year column was also unnecessary for analysis.</p>
										<pre><code>print(df.nunique())
</code></pre>
<div class="col-6"><span class="image"><img src="images/Stroke Nunique Data.png" alt="" /></span></div>		
<p></p>						
									<header>									
									<h4>First Cleaning</h4>
									</header>
										<p>Values that were unnecessary for analysis were removed from the data set. 
											The "Stratification" columns were also renamed to their respective category names.</p>
										<pre><code>#clean data
def clean_data(df):
	# Drop duplicate rows across all columns
	df = df.drop_duplicates()
	# Drop columns
	df = df.drop(columns=['DataSource', 'StratificationCategory1', 'StratificationCategory2', 'TopicID', 'Class', 'Topic'])
	# Rename column 'Stratification1' to 'Gender'
	df = df.rename(columns={'Stratification1': 'Gender'})
	# Rename column 'Stratification2' to 'Race/Ethnicity'
	df = df.rename(columns={'Stratification2': 'Race/Ethnicity'})
	return df

df_clean = clean_data(df.copy())
df_clean.head()
</code></pre>
									<h4>Data Frame Description</h4>
									</header>
										<p>Using the Pandas and Matploylib.pyplot libraries, the data was analyzed for completeness, 
											column contents, and accuracy. The majority of rows were found to be complete. Rows that 
											did not contain mortality rate data were designated in the original dataset as having 
											“Insufficient Data.” This may have been due to there not being enough of a specific population 
											in a given area to determine their stroke mortality rate and/or data collection issues. Rows 
											with insufficient data were removed from the final product.</p>
										<pre><code>print(df_clean.describe())
</code></pre>
<div class="col-6"><span class="image"><img src="images/Stroke Describe Data.png" alt="" /></span></div>
<p></p>
<pre><code>df_clean.info()
</code></pre>
<div class="col-6"><span class="image"><img src="images/Stroke Info Data.png" alt="" /></span></div>
										<p></p>	
										<h4>Second Cleaning</h4>
									</header>
											<p>Further analysis of the data revealed that the data set required more cleaning. Additionally, in order 
												to get the filters to work properly on the final visualization, numbers needed to be assigned to the 
												"GeoLevel" column.</p>
												 <pre><code>#remove more columns, add GeoLevel column
def clean_data(df_clean):
	# Clone column 'GeographicLevel' as 'GeoLevelCode'
	df_clean['GeoLevelCode'] = df_clean.loc[:, 'GeographicLevel']
	# Replace all instances of "Nation" with "1" in column: 'GeoLevelCode'
	df_clean.loc[df_clean['GeoLevelCode'].str.lower() == "Nation".lower(), 'GeoLevelCode'] = "1"
	# Replace all instances of "State" with "2" in column: 'GeoLevelCode'
	df_clean.loc[df_clean['GeoLevelCode'].str.lower() == "State".lower(), 'GeoLevelCode'] = "2"
	# Replace all instances of "County" with "3" in column: 'GeoLevelCode'
	df_clean.loc[df_clean['GeoLevelCode'].str.lower() == "County".lower(), 'GeoLevelCode'] = "3"
	# Drop columns: 'Year', 'Data_Value_Unit' and 4 other columns
	df_clean = df_clean.drop(columns=['Year', 'Data_Value_Unit', 'Data_Value_Type', 'Data_Value_Footnote_Symbol', 'Data_Value_Footnote', 'LocationID'])
	#Change column data type to int
	df_clean = df_clean.astype({'GeoLevelCode': 'int'})
	return df_clean
												
df_clean = clean_data(df_clean.copy())
df_clean.head()
</code></pre>
									<h4>Outliers</h4>
									</header>
										<p>While some extreme outliers were found, further research revealed that these much higher values were only 
											present at the county level in specific populations. The numbers were drastically higher due to the 
											population levels being so small but still being averaged at the “per 100,000 population” level. 
											The mortality rates were determined to be an accurate representation and remained in the final data set.</p>
										<pre><code>df_clean.boxplot("Data_Value")
</code></pre>

								<h2>Dashboard Building</h2>
									<p>The data was already given as rates, with no total number of strokes or population data provided. As such, it was 
										necessary to make sure that when presenting the information in visualizations, the rates were not further aggregated. 
										To do so, I mainly relied on the use of multiple filters and disabling interactions between certain visuals and slicers. <br>
									</p>
									<p>
										On the National/State level dashboard, to have the Location Name, Male, Female, and Highest State Mortality Cards, multiple filters had to 
										be used as well as filtering by the bottom 1 of the GeoLevel Code. This allowed for  the correct rate to be displayed whether 
										the U.S. or a specific state is selected. Since "1" is the national GeoLevel Code, the information for U.S. is automatically 
										displayed. When a state is selected on a slicer, the GeoLevel Code is automatically set to "2" and the rate for that specific 
										state is displayed.</p>
										<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Stroke Card Example.png" alt="" /></span></div>
										<div class="col-4"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/Stroke Card California.png" alt="" /></span></div>
									<p>A unique challenge presented by the State/County Level dashboard was preventing the aggregation of rates before the user had the opportunity 
										to select a state they wanted to view. Because <b>PowerBI</b> did not have a native slicer that forces a selection when I created the dashboard, 
										I used a Chiclet Slicer. However, Chiclet Slicers are only available in tile format, which was not an ideal way to select 1 of 50 different states. 
										In order to force the selection, I hid the Chiclet slicer behind one of the other dashboard elements and disallowed interactions between it and 
										the dropdown State slicer. This allows for forced selection while still utilizing the native dropdown slicer as seen below.</p>
